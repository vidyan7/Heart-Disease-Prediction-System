This folder contains the main Jupyter Notebook used for developing the Heart Disease Prediction System.

The notebook includes:
- Loading and exploration of the heart disease dataset
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Encoding of categorical features
- Feature selection and transformation
- Training of machine learning models
- Evaluation using performance metrics
- Saving the trained model and encoders using Pickle

This notebook represents the core machine learning workflow of the project and serves as the foundation for the deployed Flask application.
